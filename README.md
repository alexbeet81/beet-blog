# Welcome to Beet Blog.

## About

I created this site while practicing React. My aims were to build a simple multi-page SPA with React Router; have persistent login; create forms with validation feedback and use a custom hook for api-calls.

I learned a lot from making this site. But I don't think I'll be returning to it.

## Tech:

React, and deployed to firebase.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
